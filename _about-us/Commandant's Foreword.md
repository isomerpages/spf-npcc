### Commandant's Foreword

The National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC), formed in 1959, is one of the longest standing uniformed youth organisations in Singapore today with a proud heritage.

Its popularity amongst our youth is largely attributed to its close affiliation with the Singapore Police Force. Our cadets are exposed to unique opportunities to gain knowledge and familiarity with Singapore's crime prevention efforts in building a safe and secure home for us all.

Through a variety of activities, the values of resilience, integrity, service, and excellence are inculcated in our youth. These values will enable them to develop into caring and responsible citizens with a sense of purpose to serve the community.

NPCC is a fulfilling and enriching co-curricular activity which allows cadets to learn and grow significantly in personal competencies and leadership. The Corps also continually seeks to improve and craft rich and meaningful learning experiences to equip our cadets with the necessary skill sets to navigate the world of the 21st century.
