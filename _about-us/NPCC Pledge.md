We, the members of the
National Police Cadet Corps,
Do here and now solemnly
And sincerely pledge that:

We will always bear true faith
And allegiance to the President
And our Republic of Singapore;

We will always be loyal
And true to our country,
Our people and the government;

We will always be prepared
To serve our country
And the community;

We will always preserve the peace
And uphold the law.
