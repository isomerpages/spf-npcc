During this explosive period of Singapore's history, our society was fraught with problems of law and order. There was high tension and mounting hatred between the community and the Police Force. Youths were the main targets as riots and unlawful activities slowly took a stronghold of our society. Actions needed to be taken immediately to rout potential safety and security threats that were impacting the community.

Police Cadet Corps (PCC) was set up with the aim to break the barrier between the people and the Police Force and to instill a greater sense of discipline in youth and a sense of civic responsibility in them, thereby developing their moral character. The first PCC unit started only with 30 cadets and a single teacher officer - Mr. Victor Seah.

On 2 Jun 1961, the Police Cadet Corps Ordinance was enacted. All schools were given approval to set up PCC units. Siglap Secondary School and Serangoon Garden Government High School were the first to form such units. The PCC and the National Cadet Corps (NCC) came under the administration of the Ministry of Education (MOE) with the Director of Education as the Director of Cadet Forces in 1963 and in the following year, the PCC recruited female cadets. Two new units were formed in the Raffles' Girls' Secondary School and Sang Nila Utama Secondary School.

In 1968, Formation signs were introduced for unit identity. In 1969, with the integration of PCC, Army, Air & Sea, the PCC was renamed National Cadet Corps (Police).

***<u>1969 - 1978 Marching Forward</u>***
       
The beginning of 1969 saw the arm, sea, air and police cadet movements coming under a common structure with Police taking on the title of National Cadet Corps (Police). It was a decade of expansion as the Corps grew at an extraordinary pace.

In 1970, a Cadet Inspectors' unit was formed from students in Pre-U classes. The NCC (Police) was then renamed National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) in 1971.

In 1972, the "grey and khaki" uniform was changed to the present blue. In 1974, the NPCC Council was established by an Act of Parliament. On 1 Apr 1975, the NPCC Council was inaugurated by the then Minister for Education, Dr Lee Chiaw Meng.

In 1976, the NPCC Band recruited girl cadets. The NPCC service medals and clasps were introduced for officers in 1979 and a year later, Proficiency Badges were introduced.

***<u>1979 - 1988 Together, Standing Strong</u>***

In this decade, NPCC continued to spread its wings and attained a stronger identity and sense of belonging.

The first NPCC Day Observance Ceremony was held in May 1985 and was officiated by Mr. Wong Kan Seng, then Minister of State for Home Affairs. NPCC cadets nationwide attended school in their NPCC uniform and took the Pledge at the regular flag-raising ceremony. Since then, it has been a tradition that many units uphold till this day.

Campcraft Competition was introduced to promote team spirit, upgrade campcraft skills, raise efficiency in conducting outdoor activities and nurture a stronger competitive inclination. An integral part of NPCC training, campcraft activities include tent pitching, erecting a flagpole and raising a flag, lighting up a pressure lamp and more.

***<u>1989 - 1998 Mission Possible</u>***

NPCC is constantly keeping pace with the ever-changing world and remained forward looking and true to its founding values. As NPCC moved into this decade, it continued to introduce new initiatives and creating more opportunities for youth development.

In 1991, with the inauguration of Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in July, following its separation from National University of Singapore (NUS), cadets studying in the previously known Nanyang Technological Institution no longer belonged to the NUS Unit. This led to the formation of the NTU-NPCC Unit.

***<u>1999 - 2008 Steering Ahead</u>***

The Corps embarked on more overseas exchange programmes with its counterparts in the region and also ventured into coastal defence with the setting up of the NPCC Sea Unit. The NPCC Alumni was established to help cadets maintain lifelong affiliation with the Corps. The focus remains on developing team players with enduring spirit and timeless passion to continue its mission and vision well into the future.

In 1994, a new Unit Overall Proficiency Award (UOPA) was introduced to raise the standard of proficiency and efficiency in all units. Each unit was to be assessed on conformity to policies and training plans to produce useful citizens, performance in competitions that reflect the proficiency and interest of the unit as well as efficiency in the running of NPCC matters throughout the year.
