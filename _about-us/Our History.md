During this explosive period of Singapore's history, our society was fraught with problems of law and order. There was high tension and mounting hatred between the community and the Police Force. Youths were the main targets as riots and unlawful activities slowly took a stronghold of our society. Actions needed to be taken immediately to rout potential safety and security threats that were impacting the community.

Police Cadet Corps (PCC) was set up with the aim to break the barrier between the people and the Police Force and to instill a greater sense of discipline in youth and a sense of civic responsibility in them, thereby developing their moral character. The first PCC unit started only with 30 cadets and a single teacher officer - Mr. Victor Seah.

On 2 Jun 1961, the Police Cadet Corps Ordinance was enacted. All schools were given approval to set up PCC units. Siglap Secondary School and Serangoon Garden Government High School were the first to form such units. The PCC and the National Cadet Corps (NCC) came under the administration of the Ministry of Education (MOE) with the Director of Education as the Director of Cadet Forces in 1963 and in the following year, the PCC recruited female cadets. Two new units were formed in the Raffles' Girls' Secondary School and Sang Nila Utama Secondary School.

In 1968, Formation signs were introduced for unit identity. In 1969, with the integration of PCC, Army, Air & Sea, the PCC was renamed National Cadet Corps (Police).
