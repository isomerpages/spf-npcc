### Training Principles and Framework
Our training principles and framework are deeply rooted to the mission and vision of NPCC where we aim to achieve the best for the members of NPCC, ranging from our cadets to officers.

At the heart of our training principles is the 6A framework which provides direction for the training and development of all NPCC members. The 6As (AWARE, ACQUIRE, ACTUATE, ASPIRE, ACHIEVE and AIM) shows the focus for members at each level and the spiral development.

This framework sets a natural progressive learning path of an NPCC member, starting from entry as a cadet (a recruit at Secondary 1) to a youth leader at the end of the Secondary school journey and even to becoming an officer of the corps.



| Level | 6A Focus | Training outcome |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Level 1 (Sec 1)     | AWARE of Self, Others, SPF and NPCC     | Knowing oneself     |
| Level 2 (Sec 2)     | ACQUIRE skills and knowledge     | Stepping out and interacting     |
| Level 3 (Sec 3)     | ACTUATE as leader     | First taste of taking charge     |
| Level 4/5 (Sec 4/5)     | ASPIRE to serve     | Stepping out to lead     |
| Youth Leaders (CIs)     | ACHIEVE competency in skills and knowledge     | Leading others     |
| Officers     | AIM to nurture     | Developing others     |

With the 6A framework, NPCC creates meaningful learning experiences and modules with appropriate outcomes within the NPCC curriculum to help develop our NPCC members.
