### Training Principles and Framework
Our training principles and framework are deeply rooted to the mission and vision of NPCC where we aim to achieve the best for the members of NPCC, ranging from our cadets to officers.

At the heart of our training principles is the 6A framework which provides direction for the training and development of all NPCC members. The 6As (AWARE, ACQUIRE, ACTUATE, ASPIRE, ACHIEVE and AIM) shows the focus for members at each level and the spiral development.

This framework sets a natural progressive learning path of an NPCC member, starting from entry as a cadet (a recruit at Secondary 1) to a youth leader at the end of the Secondary school journey and even to becoming an officer of the corps.
