### Home Team Corps Promotion & Awards Ceremony

NPCC Officers and Volunteers work tirelessly behind the scenes to ensure NPCC cadets learn the necessary skill sets and attitudes to succeed in an ever-changing world.

The effort that goes into the enrichment and education of NPCC cadets is one that deserves due recognition.

Each year, the Home Team Corps Promotion and Awards Ceremony is held to recognize deserving officers and volunteers who are promoted or awarded Service Awards for their service to NPCC. Those who have gone above and beyond their call of duty will also be nominated to receive the Home Team Corps Award, in recognition of exemplary effort.
