### NPCC Annual Parade

        
The NPCC Annual Parade (NPAP) is the flagship event in the NPCC calendar. It marks the celebration of the NPCC Day and is also the day for NPCC to honour the outstanding achievements of its units. It also aims to instil loyalty in the cadets & dedication to the Corps. Cadets from all the units come together to form the parade contingents and put on performances for the post parade segment of NPAP.

NPAP 2021 is a unique one as we held our inaugural fully virtual parade to celebrate our 62nd anniversary on 7 May 2021, NPCC Day.

While NPAP has always been held physically at the Home Team Academy, it was not possible from 2020 to 2022 due to the COVID-19 situation. This made NPAP 2021 and 2022 unique as we celebrate with virtual parades live streamed via NPCC social media platforms and via Zoom Webinar, respectively.
