### Maritime Policing

        
The National Police Cadet Corps (Sea) or NPCC (Sea) units, whilst bearing similar organisational structures, memberships, and functions to their land counterparts, the NPCC (Sea) cadets are put through a tailored maritime training programme which makes up 50% of their training curriculum.

**Maritime Policing**

The Singapore Police Coast Guard plays a pivotal role in maintaining Singapore’s security, particularly Singapore’s maritime security. NPCC (Sea) cadets will gain an insight of the following:
1. Duties, functions and operations of the Singapore Police Coast Guard;

**Maritime Communication**

Maritime communication involve ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore communication. Over the years, the ways in which seamen communicate has changed drastically from the use of gongs, flags and day shapes to the use of radiotelephony equipment such as Very High Frequency (VHF) communication sets, Automatic Identification System (AIS) transponders and Global Positioning System (GPS) Satellites. NPCC (Sea) cadets will be taught the types of communication aids and tools available to the seamen and their uses, including those that were used in the past and those that are still very much relevant in today’s context.

**Basic Coastal Navigation**

As an extension of basic seamanship, NPCC (Sea) cadets, will be exposed to more intricate aspects of Basic Coastal Navigation. This is the form of navigation that is primarily used by the Singapore Police Coast Guard officers whilst patrolling and navigating through the waters of Singapore. This form of navigation relies on landmarks appearing on land (e.g. lighthouses, building, smokestacks) and at sea (e.g. bouys, beacons) to aid the seaman in navigating at sea.

Some topics that would be covered are:
* Compass Reading;
* Read, Understand & Interpret Chart Symbols, Abbreviation & Terms;
* Identify the salient features of the nautical chart;
* Chartwork-plotting position using geographical grid, compass bearings & Range and Bearing;
* Measuring distance on the nautical chart;
* Understanding the Maritime Buoyage System.
