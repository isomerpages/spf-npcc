### Anti-Narcotics (SANA) Course

The Anti-Narcotics course is conducted for Secondary Two Cadets in collaboration with the Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association (SANA). This course aims to heighten awareness of the threats of drug abuse, encourage cadets to understand the importance of drug prevention and thus, prevent themselves as well as others in becoming victims to drug abuse. As a youth movement, cadets would then be able to become active advocates in spreading the need for a drug-free Singapore.

In this blended course, cadets would learn about Singapore’s fight towards a drug-free Singapore and plan an awareness project to be done in their school to promote awareness to their school mates on the harmful effects of abusing drugs.

### Maritime Policing

        
The National Police Cadet Corps (Sea) or NPCC (Sea) units, whilst bearing similar organisational structures, memberships, and functions to their land counterparts, the NPCC (Sea) cadets are put through a tailored maritime training programme which makes up 50% of their training curriculum.

**Maritime Policing**

The Singapore Police Coast Guard plays a pivotal role in maintaining Singapore’s security, particularly Singapore’s maritime security. NPCC (Sea) cadets will gain an insight of the following:
1. Duties, functions and operations of the Singapore Police Coast Guard;
<ol>a. Weapons Handling (MP5 & M4A1)</ol>
<ol>b. Marksmanship firing in the Firing Simulator Trainer</ol>
2. Key events in Singapore's recent history that has shaped the Singapore Police Coast Guard operations;
3. Importance of the Singapore Police Coast Guard to Singapore's coastal security;
4. Singapore's thriving maritime landscape and economy.

**Maritime Communication**

Maritime communication involve ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore communication. Over the years, the ways in which seamen communicate has changed drastically from the use of gongs, flags and day shapes to the use of radiotelephony equipment such as Very High Frequency (VHF) communication sets, Automatic Identification System (AIS) transponders and Global Positioning System (GPS) Satellites. NPCC (Sea) cadets will be taught the types of communication aids and tools available to the seamen and their uses, including those that were used in the past and those that are still very much relevant in today’s context.

**Basic Coastal Navigation**

As an extension of basic seamanship, NPCC (Sea) cadets, will be exposed to more intricate aspects of Basic Coastal Navigation. This is the form of navigation that is primarily used by the Singapore Police Coast Guard officers whilst patrolling and navigating through the waters of Singapore. This form of navigation relies on landmarks appearing on land (e.g. lighthouses, building, smokestacks) and at sea (e.g. bouys, beacons) to aid the seaman in navigating at sea.

Some topics that would be covered are:
* Compass Reading;
* Read, Understand & Interpret Chart Symbols, Abbreviation & Terms;
* Identify the salient features of the nautical chart;
* Chartwork-plotting position using geographical grid, compass bearings & Range and Bearing;
* Measuring distance on the nautical chart;
* Understanding the Maritime Buoyage System.
