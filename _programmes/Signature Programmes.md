### Unarmed Tactics
       
In line with the NPCCâ€™s mission and vision, the NPCC Unarmed Tactics Course is introduced to the Secondary Two cadets from all NPCC secondary school units in Singapore. Cadets will be taught the basic movements including stances and shuffles, blocks, stuns and defensive techniques.

Upon acquiring the basic knowledge of unarmed tactics, trainers will demonstrate and explain to the cadets the application of the techniques in real life situations for self-protection.

The four-hour course equips the cadets with the basic knowledge of self-defense and rules of engagement which they could use to defend themselves when faced with adversity.

### Crime Scene Investigation
Crime Scene Investigation (CSI) is a form of forensic science which supports investigation, leading the authorities or the police to the facts behind an incident or a crime scene. This course is conducted for Sec 1 and 2 cadets where they will have the opportunity to learn how to solve a crime via the following lessons:


| Modules | Levels | 
| -------- | -------- | 
| Introduction to CSI     | Sec 1     |
| Introduction to Fingerprint Dusting     | Sec 1     |
| Police Photography     | Sec 2     |
| Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) Analysis     | Sec 2     |
| Blood Stain Pattern Analysis (BSPA)     | Sec 2
|
        
The Enhanced CSI is for the Sec 3 cadets where they will have an interactive hands-on experience by going through a series of crime scenes set up in mock-up HDB flats and the Virtual Reality (VR) On-Scene Investigation in Home Team Academy (HTA). This will allow them to have hands-on experience and apply the crime scene management skills which they have learnt.
