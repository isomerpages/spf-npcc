### Unarmed Tactics
       
In line with the NPCCâ€™s mission and vision, the NPCC Unarmed Tactics Course is introduced to the Secondary Two cadets from all NPCC secondary school units in Singapore. Cadets will be taught the basic movements including stances and shuffles, blocks, stuns and defensive techniques.

Upon acquiring the basic knowledge of unarmed tactics, trainers will demonstrate and explain to the cadets the application of the techniques in real life situations for self-protection.

The four-hour course equips the cadets with the basic knowledge of self-defense and rules of engagement which they could use to defend themselves when faced with adversity.
