### Cadets

      
NPCC cadets are secondary school students allocated by their respective schools to NPCC as their CCA.

They go through 4 years of learning, in domains such as basics of policing and law enforcement, adventure training as well as character building.

NPCC cadets advance in ranks as their skill proficiency increases, enabling them to lead and guide junior cadets to hone their skillsets too.

At the end of their 4 years as a NPCC cadet, they would have learnt from the leadership opportunities they have taken up, and some of them who wish to continue contributing to the Corps, may also volunteer as a Cadet Inspector to continue their NPCC journey.
