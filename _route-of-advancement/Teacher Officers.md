### Teacher Officers

        
Teacher Officers are full-time teachers in secondary schools, chosen by the school management to take up the uniformed officers' role in the NPCC units to lead, teach and guide our NPCC cadets.

They are equipped with administrative and leadership skills, and together with their professional teaching pedagogy, they shape the learning of NPCC cadets in their CCA journey.

Some Teacher Officers may also progress to be Officer-In-Charge of their units, and some might even move on further to become Assistant Commandants of NPCC.
